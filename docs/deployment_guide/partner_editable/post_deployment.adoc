== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the Deployment

To use an SSH agent to access the Nomad environment on macOS or Linux:

[arabic]
. Use the command:

----
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----

[arabic, start=2]
. At the prompt, type your passphrase or press *Enter* for no passphrase.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Hit Enter Again or Enter passphrase]

Enter same passphrase again: [Hit Enter Again or Enter passphrase]

[arabic, start=3]
. Log in to the Linux bastion host:

[loweralpha]
. In the AWS CloudFormation console, select the Linux bastion stack.
. Choose the *Outputs* tab.
. Note the value of the Elastic IP (EIP1) key. (In the example, it’s *52.206.189.125*.)

[#postdeploy1]
.Elastic IP key value for the Linux bastion host

[arabic, start=4]
. Log in, and type *yes* when prompted to continue connecting. (Use the –A option, which enables agent forwarding.)

----
ssh –A ubuntu@*52.206.189.125*
----

[#postdeploy2]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image3.png[image,width=648,height=143]

[arabic, start=5]
. In the Amazon EC2 console, select one of the Nomad server hosts and note its private IP address. (In the example, it’s *10.0.83.250*.)

[#postdeploy3]
.Private IP for the Nomad server host instance
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image4.png[image,width=648,height=364]

[arabic, start=6]
. Log in, and type *yes* when prompted to continue connecting.

----
ssh –A ubuntu@*10.0.83.250*
----

[arabic, start=7]
. Verify the integrity of the Consul cluster:

----
consul members
----

[#postdeploy4]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image5.png[image,width=648,height=360]

[arabic, start=8]
. Verify that a Nomad leader was elected:

----
nomad server-members
----

[#postdeploy5]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image6.png[image,width=648,height=107]

[arabic, start=9]
. Verify that the Nomad clients are healthy:

----
nomad node-status
----

[#postdeploy6]

==== (Optional) Create a Nomad File

To get started using Nomad, you can use the sample Nomad file provided with this Quick Start. This file will start a NGINX web server on port 80.

[arabic]
. Download the sample Nomad plan file:

----
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/hashicorp/nomad/latest/scripts/webjob.nomad -O
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Update the data center name in the Nomad file:

----
NOMAD_DC=$(nomad node-status | tail -1 | awk '\{print $2}');

sed -i "s/__DC__/$NOMAD_DC/" webjob.nomad
----

[arabic, start=3]
. Use the nomad plan command to verify that the scheduler will run successfully:

----
nomad plan webjob.nomad
----

[#postdeploy7]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image8.png[image,width=648,height=274]

[arabic, start=4]
. Run the job with the nomad run command:

----
nomad run -check-index 0 webjob.nomad
----

[#postdeploy8]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image9.png[image,width=648,height=83]

[arabic, start=10]
. Record the allocation ID from the job output. (In the example, the ID is *718e59a7*.)

[arabic, start=5]
. To inspect this allocation further, use the nomad fs command:

----
nomad fs [alloc id]

nomad fs [alloc id] alloc

nomad fs [alloc id] alloc/logs/frontend.stdout.0

nomad fs [alloc id] frontend

nomad fs [alloc id] frontend/executor.out
----

[#postdeploy9]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image10.png[image,width=648,height=424]

[arabic, start=6]
. Use nomad alloc-status to determine the web server URL:

----
nomad alloc-status 718e59a7
----

[#postdeploy10]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image11.png[image,width=648,height=279]

[arabic, start=7]
. Use curl to verify that the web job in running:

----
curl –s 10.0.38.119
----

[#postdeploy11]
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image12.png[image,width=648,height=332]
